# KLEE tutorial

- Installing and testing klee.

- Manual use of the KLEE tools for C and Rust programs.

- Simplified usage adopting `klee-sys` and `cargo klee`.

## Dependencies

Dependencies for building klee is discussed in [building klee](https://klee.github.io/build-llvm9/).

Under the hood, klee uses a `sat` solver for First Order Logic (FOL). Klee can interface to [z3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_Theorem_Prover) which is modern and efficient solver using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). In essence SMT is FOL + built in theories for reasoning on fixed-size bit-vectors, extensional arrays, datatypes, and uninterpreted functions, making it suitable for program analysis.

So first install `z3` on your system (then klee will use that instead of the default solver).

Later, you also need to have `gdb` installed, under arch by:

### Arch linux:

Under arch with `yay` installed simply:

```shell
> yay -S z3
```

```shell
> yay -S gdb
```

### Ubuntu (like) systems

> sudo apt install z3 libz3-4 libz3-cil libz3-dev libz3-java libz3-jni libz3-ocaml-de

## Install KLEE from source

The instructions recommend LLVM 9, but the current master (2.2-pre) supports LLVM 11 (which is what you would have under arch as of 2020-12-07).

Under arch you can simply:

```shell
> git clone https://github.com/klee/klee.git
> cd klee
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake ..
> make -j 8 (-j sets number of parallel builds, e.g., on a 8 threaded machine)
> sudo make install
```

Verify that you have the tool installed.

```shell
> klee -version
KLEE 2.2-pre (https://klee.github.io)
  Build mode: RelWithDebInfo (Asserts: ON)
  Build revision: 199bd43deffc614b2915f4de26475ca43d22e2ae

LLVM (http://llvm.org/):
  LLVM version 11.0.0
  Optimized build.
  Default target: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
  Host CPU: znver2
```

If your build fails at some point, consult the docs [building klee](https://klee.github.io/build-llvm9/).

## Install KLEE from `aur` (arch linux)

The `aur` package [klee](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/klee/), installs KLEE in `/usr/bin` (binaries), `/usr/include` (C-include files), and `usr/lib` (libraries). These are the default system folders respectively, so it makes it easier to compile, link, and run the KLEE tools.

```shell
> yay -S klee
> klee -version
KLEE 2.2 (https://klee.github.io)
  Build mode: Release (Asserts: ON)
  Build revision: 5719d2803e93252e5d4613f43afc7db0d72332f1

LLVM (http://llvm.org/):
  LLVM version 11.0.0
  Optimized build.
  Default target: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
  Host CPU: skylake
```

Notice, if you have previously installed from source, but want to use the `aur` instead you should remove the source installed files found in `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/local/include` and `/usr/local/lib` (please make sure that you only remove the KLEE related files).

## Why KLEE on Rust

Out the box, Rust provides superior memory safety and guarantees to well defined behavior. However there are cases where the Rust compiler (rustc) cannot statically (at compile time) ensure these guarantees. For such cases (e.g., division by zero, slice/array indexing etc.) Rust injects code for run-time verification that emit a `panic!` (with appropriate error message). While still being safe (the code never runs into memory unsafety or undefined behavior) this limits the reliability (availability) of the system (as its very hard to recover from a `panic!`.) In practice, the developer would typically reboot/reset the system (and store some error code/trace for post-mortem analysis).

With KLEE we can do better! We bind Rust `panic!` to KLEE `abort` (a path termination), and let. For all reachable `panic!`s, KLEE will provide a concrete test, which we can replay and address in our source code. When done, we have a proof of `panic` freedom and thus defined behavior, with huge impact to reliability (and security) of the system at hand.
